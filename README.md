# Air-Drop -- Jekyll

A little something to kick off all your campaigns - for Jekyll.


## Updates

git pull git@github.com:guerillalabs/air-drop--Jekyll.git


## Cloning

This command is fired from the directory where the air-drop--Jekyll repo lives on your computer. You should have already created a new blank repo that you will be pushing into. The + command at the end picks the branch.

git push git@github.com:you/your-repo.git +master:master
